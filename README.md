# Strong Password Generator

A single web application for generating fast and strong passwords directly in your browser.

## Features

- **Secure Password Generation:** Creates robust passwords using a client-side algorithm.
- **Fast and Simple:** Offers a quick and intuitive way to generate passwords.
- **Client-Side Operation:** Ensures your generated passwords remain private as the process happens entirely within your browser.

## How It Works

The core logic for generating strong passwords resides in the `password_generator.js` file, built entirely with JavaScript. This script employs an algorithm to create random and secure password combinations.

## Why This Project Exists

This project was developed purely for **didactical purposes**, serving as a practical exercise in:

- Implementing password generation algorithms in JavaScript.
- Understanding client-side web application development.
- Creating a simple yet useful tool for demonstrating JavaScript functionality.
